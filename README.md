# Undertale-3DS

# Overview
Welcome to Undertale-3DS, a fan project aiming to bring the beloved game Undertale to the Nintendo 3DS platform. Please note that this project is 100% NOT official, currently in very early development, serving as a proof of concept. As of now, not much has been added to the project, and it is not suitable for regular gameplay.

**For now the project will be closed source, though I have plans to eventually make it open source sometime in the future**
