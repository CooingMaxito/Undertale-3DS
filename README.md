# Undertale-3DS

# Overview
Welcome to Undertale-3DS, a fan project aiming to bring the beloved game Undertale to the Nintendo 3DS platform. Please note that this project is 100% NOT official, currently in very early development, serving as a proof of concept. As of now, not much has been added to the project, and it is not suitable for regular gameplay.

**For now the project will be closed source, though I have plans to eventually make it open source sometime in the future**

Check releases to get the latest builds.

# Current Progress
- Intro Cutscene (100% Done)
- Name Select (No transition from name select to main game yet)
- All the original name responses from the Name Select (Plus a few extras I added)
- 8 directional movement for player and SOUL
- Slow down SOUL when pressing B
- Overhaul of dialogue system
- Easy-to-modify dialogue system and npcs
- An awesome Pixel Perfect Camera to fit the 3ds resolution and stay faithful to the original game
- Flowey Encounter fully complete, only need to merge all the events together
- FUnctional and interactable NPCs
- New Tilemap system to create and render tilemaps for rooms
- The first six rooms of the game + a custom big room
- Proper Music playback as present in the original game

# Current Priorities
- Optimize Text (It runs really well on n3ds, lags a tiny bit on old models)
- Merge all parts of the Flowey encounter to have the first part of the game done
- Add Toriel interactions
- **SAVING SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)**

I am open to any feedback, suggestions and ideas! If you have anything in mind please let me know!
